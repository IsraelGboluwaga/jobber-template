"""LLM tailoring: produce a tailored CV (markdown) and, only if the posting has
application questions, draft answers grounded in the CV.

GROUNDING RULE (non-negotiable, stated in the system prompt): the model reorders,
reweights, and rephrases what is ALREADY in the master CV to match the JD. It
never invents experience, employers, dates, titles, or skills the candidate does
not have. If a JD asks for something absent from the CV, it stays absent. A
fabricated line is worse than a weaker application.
